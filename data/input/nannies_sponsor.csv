I trained at the Bournemouth Montessori College specializing in the education of children aged 2-6. While I am a trained teacher I consider myself a career nanny (ie. I do not nanny in-between jobs or over the summer, instead my preference is to work for a single family for a number of years). 

My previous employment experience includes working in Montessori classrooms in both the UK and New Zealand. Since 2011 I have been working as a full time nanny for 2 families. The first for 4 years in the UK prior to my immigration to Canada in 2016. I then worked for a family on the westside of Vancouver for the next 7 years. Nannying the children from ages 0-9. This position ended amicably as the family no longer required a nanny given the children‚Äôs ages.  

My duties included caring for the children, attending educational activities and classes, attending swim classes, toilet training, school drop off/ pick up, meal preparation, creating a stimulating environment, tutoring (homework help), care of pets, vacationing with the family (ie. travel abroad with the family) and overnights with the children, as required, while the parents were away.

I am hoping to connect with a family who are looking for a caring, independent, drama free Nanny. I prefer to work autonomously allowing parents to comfortably and confidently leave their child in my care - please think of me as a collaborator in raising your child. I appreciate your family and child‚Äôs privacy and do not share any of my work activities or any children I look after online. (Ie. instagram, TikTok, Facebook etc). I am also fully vaccinated. 

I am LGBTQ Friendly and have previously been employed by same sex couples.  

I have previously attended First aid courses through St Johns Canada, both general and child specific. The certifications have lapsed. However, if a current certificate is important to you we can jointly work on getting me recertified.  

I hold a full, clean, British Columbia driving license. 

I am able to converse in basic French and am always looking for opportunities to improve in this area.

I am a non-smoker with no children of my own, I currently live with my partner of 19 years and our dog, Kermit,   in East Vancouver.

I have Permanent Residency in Canada so do not require sponsorship from my employer.

I have experience with kids ages between 01 and 10 years old. I used to work in a day care and in a bilingual school teaching English to pre-k, kindergarden, and elementary school. A family can absolutely rely on me because I am faithful and helpful. Also, I had experience dealing with autistic children and other special needs. I learned how to make differentes activities for them and make them feel included with the rest of class during the learning process. This experience was amazing! Working with differents kids, from different backgrounds, made me more confident, secure and subject to a vary of child's characters, and, consequently, I do know the importance of giving them individual attention. Kids have too much to learn and to discover. I love being part of this journey. That is why I have dedicated some years of my life studying early childhood education and new techiques and approaches to teaching children differentes contents and subjects. Each kid has their on personality and this must be considered when we preparing our activities. This is what I learned during my Assosiate degree of Early childhood education. So due to my large experience dealing with children, I am sure I am able to help them develop and reach their full potential. One thing I really enjoy doing with kids is handicrafts. I love to make toys with milk cartons, cereal boxes, bottles and whatever. These kind of activities is very useful to estimulate their criativity. I can also be their tutor to help them with school homework and activities. I would also like to mention that safety and well-being of children is my priority. That is why I have decided o attend a first aid course, that made me able to know helpful things for an accident and basic care of wounds, totally catared to children. Besides, I received several safety trainings when I worked in a ship cruiseline. Every single week we had to attend a ""drill"" (a simulation of emergency situation), learning how to act and procedures to take in case of fire, explosion, bomb and sinking. As you can notice, I have both a solid experience with kids and I experience living abroad, away from my country and family. Homesick is not a problem to me. I love being connected to different cultures and having new experiences. Finally, I hope being chosen by you and you family! I am commited to taking care of your children and being aware to all my responsabilities and duties. I am a active and creative person, always motivatd and helpful, very open minded and adoptable. These are my strengths.",2023-08-13

Nice to meet you! My name is Eli≈°ka. I'm (almost) 28 year old and I'm originally from the Czech Republic. I started taking care of kids since I was 10 yo when my sister was  born. I have three younger siblings (now 25, 18 and almost 15 yo) that I'm used to take care of. I pursued my studies at secondary pedagogical school, study field preschool and out-of-school pedagogy. During the studies we had multiple teaching practices. After highschool I continued studying at Pedagogical faculty at Masaryk University in Brno, study field Social pedagogy and leisure time. By that time I started babysitting for number of families, the youngest kid outside of my family I ever babysat was 5 months old. 
Soon after I realized that I was missing my greatest hobby, art, so I switched my study field from Social pedagogy to Art and visual art with a view to education (bachelor's degree programme). I continued my master's studies at the same university at the Department of Art Education, study fields Art for primary and secondary schools and Gallery pedagogy and Art facilitation, which allows me to work at galleries and museums. After obtaining my master's degree I felt I wasn't quite done with studying, so I started my PhD studies, study field Theory of art. I taught various subjects, some for part time students too, and last semester I have been teaching one subject in English, too. 

Since 2018 until 2022 I was teaching art lectures for kids at Lu≈æ√°nky leisure centre in Brno. Throughout my PhD studies I was working part time as a kindergarten teacher and lately an assistant to an autistic boy at the same kindergarten. Since August I work as a daycare full-time in Prague (kids are ages are between 18 months and 4 years). 

As mentioned above, my biggest hobby is art - I love to paint (I also painted two kindergartens ;), draw and write - I write mostly poetry books which I also illustrate. Besides that I play the piano, guitar and ukulele (I also worked as a private piano teacher). Travelling is my passion as well, while doing so, I love visiting national parks and hiking in nature and I visiting galleries and museums as well. Gardening is super relaxing for me too, I enjoy getting muddy and working outside :). I'm also an animal lover (a cat person ;). 

I have worker as an aupair before, me and my boyfriend at the time were taking care of the two kids aged 10 months and 3 years.  

I have Working Holiday Visa, therefore I can offer you stay up to 12 months. I can start at around mid February 2023. 

I'm looking for an easygoing family who's enjoying time outdoors and love everything creative! I adore children's fantasy and openness, their kindness and immediateness. Children are great teachers when it comes to appreciating the present moments and everyday miracles. 

I'll be looking forward to hearing from you.

Kind regards,

My name is Lilith (people also call me Lili pronounced like Lilly) I‚Äôm 23 and live near downtown Brantford.
I‚Äôm hoping to find a family searching for in-home childcare to work with either full time or part time. I work in childcare because I enjoy it and am passionate about helping children learn and grow and of course making sure they are safe and well cared for. To me caring for children as a career isn‚Äôt only about catering to basic needs but is also about nurturing their mind and sense of self. It is less common now but there are people who say it‚Äôs unprofessional to form emotional bonds with the children in your care but personally I‚Äôve never found that possible. I‚Äôve grown to care deeply for the children I've worked with in the past and their families too. I feel like you pretty much have to actually get to know a child for who they are and what is going on in their lives to provide the best care possible. Yes it‚Äôs sad to say goodbye when the time comes to move on but that is the nature of the job. I know my services won‚Äôt be needed forever but if I‚Äôve helped those children and their family in any way then I can leave happy. 
 
How I view my role in your home
As an in-home childcare provider (nanny, babysitter whichever term you‚Äôd prefer) my goal is to introduce myself into a family's existing routine, not to come in and start making changes. I do have some knowledge and skills to add to a routine if wanted but I will not try to impose. I want to be like a part of your team so to speak, not an overbearing teacher that tries to tell you how to parent. Being a child care educator or teacher and being a parent are two completely different things and it‚Äôs not my place to tell you how to run your home. I don‚Äôt really believe that there is a ‚Äúright‚Äù method of parenting; and I will do my best to promote continuity of the rules and discipline your children are familiar with while you‚Äôre away. If for any reason you feel that I‚Äôve overstepped, I will not feel attacked if you point out the behavior you don‚Äôt approve of and we can come to a resolution without conflict. 
 
Practices I can not support 
With the above being said I refuse to partake in any practices of discipline that have been proven physically or mentally harmful by professionals in child psychology. This includes: any punishment meant to cause pain or physical stress, restraining or strapping down a child as a punishment or locking a child in a room alone. withholding food, drink, sleep or restroom access, shaming, belittling or humiliating a child, verbally attacking a child‚Äôs self esteem or person, telling fibs or causing fear to trick a child into compliance. 
 
All families are valid and deserve respect 
Families come in all shapes and sizes. It‚Äôs not only good practice in my line of work but my deep personal belief that no family or single person should be judged based on: race, culture, nationality or immigration status. Their sexuality or gender identity. Religious or spiritual beliefs. Class or social status. Any physical, mental or neurological conditions or disabilities. Number of parents/guardians or children in a family or how a family came to be. 
 
History and experience 
Since my early teens I‚Äôve jumped at every opportunity to get involved in childcare and learn about early childhood education. Over the years I‚Äôve casually helped family and friends care for their children and babysat for multiple families mostly relatives, friends of relatives or friends of friends. I‚Äôve had many volunteer and co-op placement experiences and even a few jobs in licensed daycare centers. I‚Äôve had experience with infants and children from 2 months to 7 years. 
I‚Äôve studied early childhood education in my free time and have also completed the ‚ÄúDual credit program in E.C.E‚Äù, this is a program offered to a small number of high school seniors that allows them to complete their final semester of high school by attending Conestoga college courses without having to pay tuition. I also attended one semester of the E.C.E program after completing the dual credit program but left the course for personal reasons that I would be glad to explain if asked. I intend on going back to school for my E.C.E diploma at some point in the future but have no set time frame of when at the moment. 
 I have experience planning and leading educational and fun activities for children of all ages using curriculum and philosophy promoted by the college of early childhood educators. 
 I have experience taking multiple children on field trips to both indoor and outdoor destinations. 
 
Other qualifications 
-I‚Äôm trained in CPR and first aid and have been recertified twice. 
-I‚Äôve submitted the documentation to have a vulnerable sector check performed by the Brantford police department. I have no criminal record and will be more than happy to show documentation of this as soon as my vulnerable sectors check has been processed. 
-I don‚Äôt smoke or drink alcohol",2023-08-03

I'm looking for a nanny/caregiver offer in BC, Canada (preferably, but not limited to, near the Nanaimo area). I would need sponsorship. If you're interested, read ahead!

My name is Alina, and I am a caring, respectful, loving and hard-working 27 year old from Brazil. I was raised in a multi-cultural family of teachers and educators, and I have spoken English since I was very small. I speak fluent Portuguese and English, and intermediate Spanish and Dutch.

I studied Acting in Los Angeles in 2015, and after that, worked in childcare with different families and children whose ages ranged from newborn to 10 years old, as well as tutoring elementary and high school aged children. In 2017, I moved to the Netherlands to be an Au Pair for a year. There, I looked after two boys of 5 and 2 years old, who I absolutely adore. Feel free to ask me for more information about my experience there or for my former host family's contact info. They would be more than happy to speak with you about their experience with me.

In 2018, I spent a year in Belgium studying Tourism, and then a few months in Alberta, Canada looking after two sweet girls of 3 and 2 years old. I came back to Brazil a few months later to pursue a Bachelor's degree in Education. During my time in university, I worked as a Teacher Aide at the American School here, and currently teach grade 2 at our Canadian International school. I also teach English to children from 1 to 4 years old every Thursday.

I am very creative and artistic. I love writing, drawing, painting, crafting and baking. I am also very interested in history, mythology, world cultures, languages, and astronomy. My favourite activities also include reading, camping, traveling, hiking, playing board games, watching movies and playing soccer. I believe childcare and education should be caring, respectful, understanding, patient and above all loving and empathetic. I believe in positive discipline.

I have a driver‚Äôs license, a valid passport, and I have attended multiple child and infant first aid and CPR courses, and have experience working with ISR. If necessary, I would be willing to redo the courses in Canada. I have experience with children with disabilities and ASD and would be able to care for one. I love animals and wouldn't be opposed to caring for your pets. I would also be able to cook and do light to medium housekeeping.

I am only looking for Live Out opportunities, and I would definitely be willing to negotiate the payment rate in a way that would be comfortable for you. If necessary, I would be able to acquire my own car in Canada.

I am hoping to work with a trustworthy, respectful, kind, and loving family. Communication, love and understanding are the key to everything in my opinion, and that's how I approach childcare. I believe children need someone who listens to them, notices their needs and talks them through their issues, rather than someone who will only be unnecessarily strict and firm.

I would need a sponsor to work in Canada. Let me know if you're interested and/or would like to talk or learn more about it, and I will be happy to arrange that and/or a video chat.
Feel free to send me a message if you're interested in talking about sponsoring me to be your next nanny and/or if you have any questions for me! I'd love to hear from you and your family!

I hope to meet you soon!

Experience as a Nanny:

I have substantial experience working as a nanny, caring for children of various age groups. This hands-on experience has honed my ability to create a nurturing and safe environment where children can thrive. My background allows me to provide age-appropriate activities and educational support tailored to each child's needs, fostering their intellectual, social, and emotional growth.

Teaching Expertise:

My experience as both a nanny and a teacher for toddlers and teenagers uniquely positions me to provide holistic care and support to your children. As a teacher, I have acquired valuable skills in lesson planning, creating engaging activities, and maintaining a structured yet enjoyable learning environment. These skills seamlessly transfer to my role as a nanny, enabling me to assist with homework, provide educational stimulation, and promote lifelong learning.

Bilingual Advantage:

Being fluent in Portuguese and having specialized in language acquisition, I offer the added benefit of exposing your children to a rich linguistic environment. Bilingualism has been proven to enhance cognitive development, improve problem-solving skills, and promote cultural understanding. By incorporating Portuguese into daily interactions, activities, and play, I can help your children develop strong language skills from an early age.

I'm confident that I can provide the comfort and safety of a loving home while also giving your children guidance and support. I'm looking forward to hearing from you!",2023-07-25

Hello my name is Joy. I'm searching for a full time nanny job opportunity in any location within Alberta. I am currently residing in the Philippines. I have relatives in Calgary where I can stay but I prefer a live in work setting.  I am committed to being a hard working, exceptional candidate. My availability is flexible and can travel to CA before this year ends if chosen in God‚Äôs perfect timing.

I applied for HCCP caregiver pilot program in april2020 with my first employer, but the process took so long due to pandemic. In October 2022, IRCC requested for medical and additional requirements, I complied and passed. This year February2023, IRCC sent an email to my employer requesting for financial ability to pay for a caregiver and a valid reason why she needed a nanny. Unfortunately, her financial situation has changed due to pandemic and declared zero income for the last two years already. Now I am devastated to hear the news that IRCC may refuse my application. I am currently looking for another employer to proceed on my application that can provide all the requirements needed by IRCC. All government fees and medicals were already paid. I also paid for an immigration consultant, AV Locky Immigration Solutions Inc, as my legal representative to help us with the smooth process.

If can comply within 30days from june 30, 2023 and all documents are proven genuine and valid, approval of work permit and visa will be released in 2-3months.

Thank you and I hope we can help each other.

Personal Profile: Hi I am Analyn or Ana for short.

I'm Currently in Langley, BC right now!üçÅ

Summary of my background: I have a valid multiple 10 years tourist visa in Canada.  I travel to Canada since 2018 to last 2020 during the first hit of pandemic, I stayed for almost 6 months because of travel ban and flight cancellations. During my stay in Canada my boss  loves to travel and generously treat us to different cities and provinces, that's why I really love to go back in Canada to have a better future and show my skills and talent to my future employer. I love the culture and the beautiful nature.

I'm willing to come as visitor if you need a nanny immediately and process my work permit inside Canada. 

Work Experience: My professional skilled work  is a Senior Documentation Specialist in a private consultancy for 8 years, but I used to take care of my bed ridden sister. She has a cerebral palsy since she was born. I used to take care of my nieces and nephews and I also took care of my father when he became a colon cancer patient. I don't have a previous employer as a nanny or care giving certificate, but my experience from taking care of my family is beyond amazing experience! 

I'm incredibly comfortable with live in care provision, children's crafting, and grocery shopping.

When I can start: Immediately.",2023-07-21

I‚Äôm a trilingual nanny from Brazil (Portuguese-BR/English/Spanish). I am a warm and nurturing nanny with 10 years of experience working with all ages until pre-teen. I love to help families ease their day-to-day stresses by making sure their little ones are taken care of with lots of love and patience and I look forward to helping your children grow and learn in a happy, healthy environment!
Currently I‚Äôm working for a family here in my country ‚Äì here I take care of a 2 years old little boy called Davi Luca (he is the cute little boy in my profile picture ‚Äì his family authorized me to have his pic in my profile). I took care of him since he was only 2 weeks old, but his family is looking for a part-time nanny just for weekends, because he‚Äôs going to full time school and unfortunately I need a full-time work. I‚Äôm working with them until they find the best nanny that could fit with their family, we have a great relationship and everything is going well! They would be happy to speak with you about me if you would like!
Before working for them I took care of little Ana (she is the cute girl in my profile picture ‚Äì her family authorized me to have her pic in my profile), now she is 14 years old and I took care of her since she was only 3 years old till when she was 7 years old. I stopped working for her family because unfortunately/fortunately I passed to university in another city. After that I worked for them just on summer and winter vacations. 
It‚Äôs sad because Ana is a super fun little girl and we had a great connection ‚Äì but I‚Äôm grateful that I had the opportunity of working with this amazing family! Ana‚Äôs parents are truly wonderful people and we have a great relationship, they became my family and we would help each other with everything. For sure we will to keep our friendship for life! I‚Äôm happy to provide a reference letter from them if you would like.
I was in charge of getting them dressed and ready in the morning, school drop offs and pickups (for Ana only, since Davi stayed home with me all day), all their meals, their laundry, nap time, bath time and all other activities like storytime at the library, going to museums and playgrounds, age-appropriate cooking, singing, storytelling, activities outside home, arts and crafts, etc. As you can imagine, I love working as a nanny and I know I do it well. I love to help children learn and explore in a safe, warm, and joyful environment. 
My first language is Portuguese and I‚Äôve been studying English since I was a little girl. I also studied Spanish in high school and college, but unfortunately, due to lack of practice, I don't believe it to be at a high level anymore. Also I‚Äôm studying French as my 4th language.
I have a college degree, first aid, CPR certifications and Criminal background check is current. I am a good swimmer and I am fully vaccinated. I still don‚Äôt have a driver‚Äôs license, but I‚Äôm working on it. Further, I understand the process for immigration and have information about how to proceed with the sponsorship application. A job offer is the next step in my process! 
So I have a lot of experience with all ages until preteen, I have been a nanny for 2 consecutive years now and I have 10 years of experience total. I have greatly enjoyed my time working with kids, I truly think that it is a gift to see the world through their eyes. I‚Äôm very happy to offer high quality care to your children, and I am comfortable performing light housework and cooking if required. I‚Äôm available by email at [email¬†protected]*******.com! Can‚Äôt wait to hear from you! 
Thank you for reading my letter.

P.S. 1: I would like to inform you that under the Home Child Care Provider Pilot (HCCP), employers do not need to obtain an LMIA and pay a fee of $1,000. However, the program will only open on January 1st, 2024, with a limited number of applications accepted each year, and I will have all requirements completed by that date.
P.S. 2: I have been to Canada in 2014, in Toronto, and felt in love with the people over there, that`s why now I am applying to be an nannyin Canada, I also have an eTA.",2023-07-18

I am currently looking to help a second family as a part time, live out nanny in Toronto. I have availability Monday through Friday outside the hours of 3-6pm, as well as open overnight and weekend availability. I would ideally love to help a second family on weekday mornings, but I'm open to split shifts/evenings/weekends as well.

I have a substantial background in childcare which has most recently included employment as private nanny and household manager (I have performed contracted short-term work with several families since 2020). I have been working with children since 2016 in various settings, and since beginning work as a full-time private nanny I have gained invaluable professional experience caring for children ages 7 months to 8 years, frequently caring for up to four children at a time.

I have previously worked as a counsellor and Head Dance Instructor at two high-profile summer camps, after having been a dance instructor to children ages 4 to 16. Additionally I have experience working as a private tutor teaching French to elementary-age children.

I have had all three vaccinations. I am taking COVID-19 precautions seriously and hope to find a family who does the same.

 I am fluent in French, having attained a French Immersion diploma as well as having successfully taken the CEFR French language exam, achieving the C3 Professional Fluency level.

Further credentials include merited status as both Ontario Scholar and later Academic Honour Roll at the university level. Additionally I have achieved certification as a qualified dance teacher through the BATD (British Association of Teachers of Dancing) with 18 years of dance experience; I am also proficient in several instruments (cello, piano, guitar, ukulele). During my undergraduate degree I competed nationally as a Varsity athlete for the university's elite cheerleading team. If any of these skills are of special interest to your family, I would be thrilled to incorporate them into my childcare and introduce them to your children if desired. 

My most enjoyed hobbies include reading and crocheting. I also love listening to a good podcast (usually in the historical genre- I'm currently fascinated with learning about Medieval and Renaissance Europe)!

I additionally have experience with other childcare-adjacent tasks such as tutoring, house cleaning, house management, and meal prep/cooking.

If it seems like I might be a good fit for your family please don't hesitate to reach out. Cheers!",2023-07-18

My name is Maddie, and I am an Australian Paediatric Registered Nurse. I am 29 years old (30 in August!) and have been living in Squamish since November 2022.

I am currently nannying for an amazing family in the Garibaldi Highlands however they have reached school age and no longer need me. Therefore, I am on the search again for another family that I can grow with!

I am looking for the perfect family that will treat me as a family member, as I will with your children. I am looking for a full-time role starting mid-August/ early September however I am happy to work around your family needs. I am finishing my current role mid-August and am available for part-time or casual work right now!

I have an extensive amount of experience with children as I have been nannying since I was 16 and have been a Registered Nurse the past 6 years. Prior to moving to Canada, I practiced in a Paediatric Intensive Care in a tertiary children‚Äôs hospital, in Sydney. I am very passionate about children having a fun and educated childhood. I have a large amount of experience with newborns to five-year old‚Äôs, and I am very comfortable with feeding, changing, and spending developmental-care time with infants. I absolutely thrive with 24 months and under, however this does not limit me to an age group.

I have had a mix of jobs that have allowed me to work with children. When I finished high school, I moved the U.K. for a year and worked full-time in an all-girls boarding house. Whilst I was studying my nursing degree, I held a casual role as a swimming instructor. This has made me very comfortable working with children in outdoor activities and particularly working the children around water, in a safe environment.

I would be happy to help with light-housework and pet care. I hold an Australian and BC driver‚Äôs licence and an Australian working with children check. I also have a reliable car so I can comfortably commute around Squamish. I am an animal-lover, non-smoker and hold a valid working holiday visa.

Please let me know if I would be a good fit for your family. I would be happy to send through my resume and answer any questions that you may have. If you would like to organise a face-to-face meeting, I would love to meet you! I am also happy to provide references.

I am looking for a full-time 40 hours a week role. I am happy to combine this with two families or nanny-share. Please note, I am only available until the 31st of December, 2023. 

Looking forward to hearing from you!",2023-07-18

I am a very reliable, organized and trustworthy person. 
Currently I am looking for a life change moving to Canada with my family in order to give my kids a better future. I am not going to need accomodation. I am not a millennial looking at my mobile every 5 minutes or recording the kids to have a ""like"" on tik tok, I am not going to do this ever. I have enough life experience to know how to deal with any problem, accident or natural disaster that may occur. My kids are grown now so they are not going to take me time while I am working.
I can manage house grocery shopping, cooking meals, light cleaning duties. If you need overnight or weekends time I would be able to take care of your kids. I love making different activities for children, I spent a lot of time searching for different activities: cooking, crafts, learning, education and playing. 
I am physically able to do this job, emotionally, mental and energetically. I have very strong family values.
I am currently living in Mexico City so I will need a job offer in order to start the process of applying for a work permit from here meanwhile I can update my First Aid and CPR courses at the Red Cross. I do not need assistance to relocate, I can travel and get there on my own. I know that the province has greatly improved the immigration process.I would love to elaborate more of my personal and professional profile if you have further questions.",2023-07-18
